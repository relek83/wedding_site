Questions and Answers

travel and accomodations:

  Will there be some kind of organized transfer?
  No, we'll just meet at the church at 13:15.

  Where can I park?
  Parking is free on the weekends in the 1st district. The locations are close to each other so you won't need your car.

  How can I get home at night?
  The 916 bus is in service all night at the castle and it hits every major traffic hub in the city.
